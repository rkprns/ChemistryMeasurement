    <p style ="font-size: 18px; text-align: left">In this part of the lab your will be looking more closely into solutions.  A solution is a <b>homogenous mixture of 2 or more substances.</b> The substance that is <b>being dissolved</b> is the <b>solute</b>.  The substance that <b>dissolves the solute</b> is the "solvent." Solvent and solute work very well as discriptors for a liquid solvent and a solid solute; however, if both are liquids (such as ethyl alcohol and water), or both are solids (such as bronze which is a metal alloy of coppe and tin), it is not as clear which one can be classified as the solvent vs the solute. Regardless, two solids, two liquids, or two gases can make a solution.</p>
    <p style ="font-size: 18px; text-align: left">In this lab we will be working with <b>liquid solvents and solid solutes</b>.  You will be finding the saturation point at different temperatures.  The <b>saturation point</b> is the point at which no more solute can be dissolved in the solute and starts to <b>settle out</b> of the solution. At this point, you have turned your solution into a <b>suspension</b> and it is now <b>oversaturated</b>. At the point immediately prior to this, your solution is <b>saturated</b>. You can increase the <b>saturation point</b> by increasing the heat. Follow the steps below to complete this portion of your lab.</p>
    <ol style ="font-size: 18px; text-align: left">
      <li><b>Task 1: </b> Set the temperature to<b> 0 C</b>. For each solute, <b>slowly add the solute to the solvent</b> and determine how much solute is <b>required to saturate</b> the solution.  Record the values for each of solutes in <b>table 3.</b></li>
      <li><b>Task 2: </b>Set the temperature to <b>100 C</b> and repeat task 1 for all of the solutes.  Record those values in <b>table 3</b></li>
      <li><b>Task 3: </b>For just <b>NaNO<sub>3</sub></b>, repeat task 1 for <b>20 C and 60 C</b>.  Record those values in<b>table 3</b></li>
    <li><b>Task 4: </b>Create a<b> graph </b>to show the <b>effect of temperature on the solubility of NaNO<sub>3</sub>.</b> Use google sheets.  If you cannot remember how to make a graph, refer back to your introduction to graphing assignment.  For this graph, your <b>x-axis</b> should be <b>temperature</b> and your <b>y-axis</b> should be <b>grams of solute</b>. Copy and paste your graph into your assignment.</li>
      <li><b>Task 5: </b>Each member of your group should find <b>3 mixtures</b> in your home and determine whether they are <b>solutions, suspensions, or colloids using the tyndall effect</b> (use your phone light as a flashlight). Fill out <b>table 4.</b></li>
      <li><b>Task 6: </b> Answer the reflection questions in your assignment.</li>
